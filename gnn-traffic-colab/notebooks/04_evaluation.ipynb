To put your project into Google Colab, you can follow these steps:

1. **Upload Your Files**: You can upload your project files directly to Google Colab. Use the file upload feature in Colab to upload your `.py` files, data files, and any other necessary resources.

2. **Mount Google Drive**: If your project files are stored in Google Drive, you can mount your Google Drive in Colab. This allows you to access files directly from your Drive. Use the following code snippet to mount your Drive:

   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')

3. **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure that all necessary libraries are installed in the Colab environment. You can install libraries using pip commands. For example:

   !pip install pandas numpy torch torch-geometric

4. **Run Your Code**: After uploading your files or mounting your Drive, you can run your code in the Colab cells. Make sure to adjust any file paths in your code to reflect the Colab environment.

5. **Save Your Work**: If you make changes to your code, you can save your work back to Google Drive or download the modified files to your local machine.

By following these steps, you can effectively run your project in Google Colab.
