To put your project into Google Colab, you can follow these steps:

1. **Upload Your Files**: You can upload your project files directly to Google Colab. Use the file upload feature in Colab to upload your `.md` files, Python scripts, and any other necessary files.

2. **Mount Google Drive**: If your project files are stored in Google Drive, you can mount your Google Drive in Colab. This allows you to access files directly from your Drive.

   Use the following code to mount your Google Drive:

   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')

3. **Install Required Libraries**: Make sure to install any libraries that your project depends on. You can do this using pip commands in a code cell. For example:

   !pip install pandas numpy geopandas torch torch-geometric

4. **Run Your Code**: You can then run your Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks directly in Colab. Make sure to adjust any file paths in your code to match the structure in Colab.

5. **Save Your Work**: After making changes or running your project, you can save your work back to Google Drive or download the modified files.

By following these steps, you can effectively run your project in Google Colab.
