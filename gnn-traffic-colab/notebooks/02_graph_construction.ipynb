To put your project into Google Colab, you can follow these steps:

1. **Upload Your Files**: You can upload your project files directly to Google Colab. Use the file upload feature in Colab to upload your `.py` files, data files, and any other necessary resources.

2. **Mount Google Drive**: If your project files are stored in Google Drive, you can mount your Google Drive in Colab. This allows you to access files directly from your Drive.

   Use the following code snippet to mount your Google Drive:

   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')

3. **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure that all the libraries your project depends on are installed in the Colab environment. You can install them using pip commands in a code cell. For example:

   !pip install pandas numpy geopandas torch torch-geometric

4. **Run Your Code**: After uploading your files and installing the necessary libraries, you can run your code in the Colab environment. You can create new code cells to execute your scripts or functions.

5. **Save Your Work**: If you make changes to your files, you can save them back to Google Drive or download them to your local machine.

By following these steps, you should be able to run your project in Google Colab successfully.
