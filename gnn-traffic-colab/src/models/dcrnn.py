To put your project into Google Colab, you can follow these steps:

1. **Upload Your Files**: You can upload your project files directly to Google Colab. Use the file upload feature in Colab to upload your `.py` files, data files, and any other necessary resources.

2. **Mount Google Drive**: If your project files are stored in Google Drive, you can mount your Google Drive in Colab. This allows you to access files directly from your Drive. Use the following code to mount your Drive:

   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')

3. **Install Required Libraries**: Make sure to install any libraries that your project depends on. You can do this using pip commands in a code cell. For example:

   !pip install pandas numpy torch torch-geometric

4. **Run Your Code**: You can run your Python scripts directly in the Colab environment. If your project is structured in multiple files, you can import them as modules.

5. **Save Your Work**: If you make changes to your files, you can save them back to Google Drive or download them to your local machine.

6. **Use Notebooks**: Consider converting your project into a Jupyter Notebook format (`.ipynb`) for better interactivity. You can create a new notebook in Colab and copy your code into it.

By following these steps, you should be able to run your project in Google Colab successfully.
