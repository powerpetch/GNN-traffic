To put your project into Google Colab, you can follow these steps:

1. **Upload Your Files**: You can upload your project files directly to Google Colab. Use the file upload feature in Colab to upload your `.py` files, data files, and any other necessary resources.

2. **Mount Google Drive**: If your project files are stored in Google Drive, you can mount your Google Drive in Colab. This allows you to access files stored in your Drive directly from your Colab notebook.

   Use the following code to mount your Google Drive:

   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')

3. **Install Required Libraries**: Make sure to install any libraries that your project depends on. You can do this using pip commands in a Colab cell. For example:

   !pip install pandas numpy torch torch-geometric

4. **Run Your Code**: You can now run your Python scripts or Jupyter notebook cells in Colab. If your project is structured in a way that requires running specific scripts, you can use the following command to run a script:

   !python /path/to/your/script.py

5. **Save Your Work**: If you make changes to your files in Colab, remember to save them back to your Google Drive or download them to your local machine.

By following these steps, you can effectively run your GNN Traffic Prediction & Smart Navigation System project in Google Colab.
