To put your project into Google Colab, you can follow these steps:

1. **Upload Your Files**: You can upload your project files directly to Google Colab. Use the file upload feature in Colab to upload your `.py` files, data files, and any other necessary resources.

2. **Mount Google Drive**: If your project files are stored in Google Drive, you can mount your Google Drive in Colab. This allows you to access files directly from your Drive.

   Use the following code to mount your Google Drive:

   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')

3. **Install Required Libraries**: Make sure to install any libraries that your project depends on. You can use pip commands in a Colab cell to install libraries.

   For example:
   !pip install pandas numpy torch torch-geometric

4. **Run Your Code**: You can create a new notebook in Colab and write your code in the cells. You can also import your uploaded files or files from Google Drive into your notebook.

5. **Save Your Work**: You can save your notebook in Google Drive or download it to your local machine.

By following these steps, you can successfully run your project in Google Colab. If you have specific files or code that you need help with, please let me know!
