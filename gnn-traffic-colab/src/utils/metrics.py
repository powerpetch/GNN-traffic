To put your project into Google Colab, you can follow these steps:

1. **Upload Your Files**: You can upload your project files directly to Google Colab. Use the file upload feature in Colab to upload your `.py` files, datasets, and any other necessary files.

2. **Mount Google Drive**: If your project files are stored in Google Drive, you can mount your Google Drive in Colab. This allows you to access files directly from your Drive.

   Use the following code to mount your Google Drive:

   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')

3. **Install Required Libraries**: If your project requires specific libraries that are not pre-installed in Colab, you can install them using pip. For example:

   !pip install torch torchvision torch-geometric

4. **Run Your Code**: You can create a new notebook in Google Colab and start running your code. You can copy and paste your code into the cells or reference the files you uploaded.

5. **Save Your Work**: After making changes or running your project, you can save your notebook to Google Drive or download it to your local machine.

By following these steps, you can effectively run your project in Google Colab. If your project is complex and requires specific configurations, you may need to adjust your code accordingly to ensure compatibility with the Colab environment.
