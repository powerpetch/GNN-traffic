To put your project into Google Colab, you can follow these steps:

1. **Upload Your Files**: You can upload your project files directly to Google Colab. Use the file upload feature in Colab to upload your `.py` files, datasets, and any other necessary files.

2. **Mount Google Drive**: If your project files are stored in Google Drive, you can mount your Google Drive in Colab. This allows you to access files directly from your Drive.

   Use the following code to mount your Google Drive:

   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')

3. **Install Required Libraries**: Make sure to install any libraries that your project depends on. You can do this using pip commands in a code cell.

   For example:
   !pip install pandas numpy torch torch-geometric

4. **Run Your Code**: You can copy and paste your code into a Colab notebook cell or create a new Python file in Colab and run it.

5. **Save Your Work**: After making changes or running your project, you can save your notebook or export it to your Google Drive.

By following these steps, you can effectively run your project in Google Colab. If your project is large or has many dependencies, consider breaking it down into smaller parts or modules for easier management.
