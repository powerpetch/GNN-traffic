To put your project into Google Colab, you can follow these steps:

1. **Upload Your Files**: You can upload your project files directly to Google Colab. Use the file upload feature in Colab to upload your `.py` files, datasets, and any other necessary files.

2. **Mount Google Drive**: If your project files are stored in Google Drive, you can mount your Google Drive in Colab. This allows you to access files directly from your Drive.

   Use the following code to mount your Google Drive:

   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')

3. **Install Required Libraries**: Make sure to install any libraries that your project depends on. You can do this using pip commands in a Colab cell.

   For example:
   !pip install pandas numpy torch torch-geometric

4. **Run Your Code**: You can copy and paste your code into Colab cells or create a new Python file in Colab and run it. Make sure to adjust any file paths to match the structure in Colab.

5. **Save Your Work**: You can save your Colab notebook to your Google Drive or download it as a `.ipynb` file.

By following these steps, you can successfully run your project in Google Colab. If you have specific files or code that you want to run, please let me know!
